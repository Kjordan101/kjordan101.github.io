## Projects
**Insurance Premiums and Probability of Death Case Study [(demo)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinjordan323232/insurance-project)**
- Conducted comprehensive analysis using **Python**, using **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and multiple libraries to asses the correlations between BMI, mortality probability, and life expectancy as they relate to insurance cost.
- Developed comprehensive visualizations to unearth valuable insights into the relationships between different variables within the data set.
- Employed Random Forest Regression to accurately predict insurance expenses and mortality probability, achieving an outstanding 85% and 95% accuracy respectively, aiding in precise risk assessment for insurance models.
**Education's Effect on Income Case Study [(demo)](https://github.com/Kjordan101/Education-s-Effect-on-Income-Case-Study/blob/main/jobprojections.ipynb)**
- Conducted analysis leveraging data available via Bureau of Labor Statistics, investigating the intricate relationship between educational attainment and annual income.
- Employed **Google Sheets** to meticulously refine and preprocess raw data, optimizing its suitability for integration into **Google BigQuery**.
- Queried Data using **SQL** and **Python** via BigQuery API in order to develop visualizations and draw insight on employment data.
- Crafted an intuitive **Tableau** dashboard to showcase pivotal discoveries from the study.

**Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study [(demo)](https://github.com/Kjordan101/cyclistic-bike-share/blob/main/cyclistic-bike-share-case-study.ipynb)** 
- Developed a case study using data from a fictional bike-sharing company Cyclistic as a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
- Compiled data from across multiple CSVs into a single data frame to organize data efficiently.
- Utilized libraries such as **tidyr, dplyr, and ggplot in R** to clean, manipulate, and visualize data from a data frame of over 1 million entries.
- Assessed user activity to locate business inefficiencies and created insightful visualizations to communicate these findings.

**United States GDP Analysis [(demo)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinjordan323232/gdp-analysis)**
- Developed a case study utilizing economic data publicly available via the FRED database as a capstone project for the Google ExploreCSR program. 
- Utilized libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in Python** to clean and visualize data leading to a better understanding of the correlation between US GDP and key Economic indicators.

## Work Experience
